# Scaffolding

Plumbs together all of the small libraries that make up a Scratch project runner into one mostly cohesive package.

This was originally part of the [TurboWarp Packager](https://packager.turbowarp.org/) (and is still used by it) but we think it is useful on its own too.

## API documentation

We will migrate the documentation of the packager over here soon.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TurboWarp/scaffolding.git
cd scaffolding
npm run build
```
